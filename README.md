# Test Task Code Reviewers

### Given

- In the `main.py` file is an example of real code that a student has submitted for a task.
- Here is the text of the task [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XkThc-84E6yzcZ6O4UkriTBwDFe9yfRCNvsNVci9CX4/edit)
- Here you can find the general student requirements for the code [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1koouRJP-wCsNWz-KhVM15-cmgZOJAAX6R8uU8usUtKU/edit)

### What you should do

- You need to review this code. Find errors, inaccuracies, inefficient places in it, or give some optional recommendations for improvement.
- You can make a fork of the repository or gist (do not send a Pull Request to this repository) and place comments on the problematic lines in `main.py`.
- Keep in mind that you are "reviewing" the student, that is, you do not just need to correct mistakes, you need to leave comments and recommendations.

### How to submit

- In the form, attach a link to your repository or to gist with comments.
